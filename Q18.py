# Q.18 What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple.
<!-- 
1. Mutability:
Lists are mutable, which means you can change their elements, add new elements, or remove existing elements after the list is created.
Tuples are immutable, which means once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.

2. Syntax:
Lists are defined using square brackets [].
Tuples are defined using parentheses ().

3. Usage:
Use lists when you need a collection of items that can be modified or extended.
Use tuples when you need a collection of items that should not be changed, such as coordinates, database records, or constant values. -->
