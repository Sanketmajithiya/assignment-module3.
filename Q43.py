# Q.43 Why Do You Use the Zip () Method in Python? 

""" In Python, the zip() function is used to combine multiple iterable objects (such as lists, tuples, or strings) into a single iterator that yields tuples of corresponding elements from each iterable. 
This makes it easy to iterate over multiple sequences simultaneously.

- Zip is an in-built function in Python used to iterate over multiple iterables.
It takes corresponding elements from all the iterable passed to it and merges them in a tuple ."""
