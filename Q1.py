# Q.1 What is List? How will you reverse a list? 

"""
In Python, a list is a data structure that is used to store a collection of items. Lists are mutable, which means you can change the elements they contain. Lists are defined by enclosing a comma-separated sequence of items within square brackets [ ].
 """
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_list.reverse()

print(my_list)
