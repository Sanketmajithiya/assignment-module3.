# Q.52 How Many Basic Types Of Functions Are Available In Python? 

"""
Built-in Functions: These are functions that are built into the Python interpreter and are available for use without needing to import any module. Examples include print(), len(), sum(), etc.

User-defined Functions: These are functions defined by the user to perform a specific task. User-defined functions are created using the def keyword.

Anonymous Functions (Lambda Functions): These are small, inline functions that do not have a name. They are created using the lambda keyword and are often used for short, one-liner operations.
